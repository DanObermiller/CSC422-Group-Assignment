# To run on Windows via command line:
This assumes you have already installed and setup Java on your computer. If you have not, please do so.
Navigate to src/petApplication. You will see three files: database.java, pet.java, and main.java.
Right click there, and this will bring up a context menu. Click "Open in Terminal".

Then, type this command: 
```java Main.java```
(It's case sensitive!)

The program should compile and run automatically from there.

Alternatively, you could import this into a Java IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ and run it from there.
